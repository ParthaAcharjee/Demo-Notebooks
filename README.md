# My Notebooks
## Machine Learning
In these notebooks, I explore different machine learning concepts.
#### Kernel Demo Notebook.ipynb
A demo of the usefulness of different kernels from the SVM's point of view
#### Bag of classifiers.ipynb
In this notebook, we create a synthetic dataset and classify that dataset using different classifiers.
#### Regularization Demo.ipynb
In this notebook, we'll explore different aspects of L1 and L2 regularization.

## TensorFlow
In these notebooks, I implement different machine learning algorithms in tensorFlow.
#### Linear Regression in TensorFlow.ipynb
Implementaion of Linear Regression in TensorFlow.
#### Logistic Regression in TensorFlow.ipynb
Classify MNIST dataset in tensorFlow using logistic regression.
#### Multi-layer percepton in Tensorflow.ipynb 
Implementation of MLP in tensorFlow [open](Multi-layer percepton in Tensorflow.ipynb)
