# My Notebooks
## Machine Learning
In these notebooks, I explore different machine learning concepts.
#### Kernel Demo Notebook.ipynb
A demo of the usefulness of different kernels from the SVM's point of view. [(open)](https://github.com/ParthaAcharjee/Demo-Notebooks/blob/master/Kernel%20Demo%20Notebook.ipynb)
#### Bag of classifiers.ipynb
In this notebook, we create a synthetic dataset and classify that dataset using different classifiers. [(open)](https://github.com/ParthaAcharjee/Demo-Notebooks/blob/master/Bag%20of%20classifiers.ipynb)
#### Regularization Demo.ipynb
In this notebook, we'll explore different aspects of L1 and L2 regularization. [(open)](https://github.com/ParthaAcharjee/Demo-Notebooks/blob/master/Regularization%20Demo.ipynb)

## TensorFlow
In these notebooks, I implement different machine learning algorithms in tensorFlow.
#### Linear Regression in TensorFlow.ipynb
